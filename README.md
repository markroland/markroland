# Mark Roland

Thanks for checking out my work. Most of my projects either support my business or are personal projects in the areas of creative visual coding.

My goal with github is to share the things I've created in order to give back to the community that has helped me get to where I am today.

More about my projects can be found on my website at https://markroland.com.
